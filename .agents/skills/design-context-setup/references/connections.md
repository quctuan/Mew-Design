# Connections

Do this before building the scaffold. What Codex can see changes what the files need to say.

Recommend by job. Never hand over a catalogue — a designer who connects everything available has built a slower, more ambiguous setup, not a stronger one.

## The two that matter

**A Figma server.** Turns "paste me the hex" into Codex reading variables, components and screenshots directly. Without it, every token rule the designer writes is aspirational.

**A browser.** This is the verification loop. Screenshot the built thing, compare it to the Figma frame, list differences, fix them. Anthropic's most emphasised practice is giving Codex a check it can run; for a designer, a visual diff *is* that check. Without a browser there is no check, and the designer stays the bottleneck on every mistake.

Everything else is conditional.

## Which Figma server

Use the direct Figma MCP connection and explicit file scope; follow `figma-mcp-api` for the actual tool contract.

Use the existing primary connection when it meets the task. Explain any additional connection before adding it. Figma MCP executes against a real file: pin the target and scope and follow the kit's restore-point rules before a canvas write. Setup inspection is read-only unless the designer authorizes changes.

## Conditional connections

| What they are trying to do | Connect |
|---|---|
| Content that changes without a redesign | Notion, or a real CMS |
| Specs and tickets that already live elsewhere | Linear or Notion — only if they genuinely work there |
| Anything involving a repo | the `gh` CLI, not an MCP server |

**On the CMS question.** Frame it as a design decision, not an integration. Ask: *does any content in this product change without a redesign?* If yes, model it now. The moment a designer models real content, they stop designing screens around fake data and start designing around the real shape. Notion is the cheapest way for a designer to do that without waiting on an engineer.

**On repos.** CLI tools are the most context-efficient way to reach an external service, and Codex already knows how to drive `gh`. Recommend it over a GitHub MCP server.

## Hygiene rules

- **Two or three servers, chosen deliberately.** If a human cannot say which tool a job needs, Codex cannot either.
- **Prune anything unused for a week.** Connections are not free and they never announce themselves as the problem.
- **Never run two servers that do the same job** unless the designer knows which one is primary.

## Writing `.codex/config.toml`

Use existing host connections first. For local Codex CLI, `codex mcp add` configures user MCP servers; inspect them with `codex mcp list`. `start-codex` only checks CLI Figma configuration; desktop connections are verified through the session tools. Never ask for tokens in chat.

For project-shared settings, merge non-secret server configuration into `.codex/config.toml`; do not replace an existing file. Project configuration depends on Codex trust and host policy. Secrets belong in local user configuration or environment variables, never in tracked files.

```toml
[mcp_servers.example]
url = "https://example.com/mcp"
```

Use the direct Figma MCP connection and explicit file scope; follow `figma-mcp-api` for the actual tool contract.
